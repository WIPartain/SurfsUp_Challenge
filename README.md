# SurfsUp_Challenge
## Overview

The purpose of this project was to analyze temperatures in Oahu during the months of June and December.  We wanted to determine if these months would lend ideal conditions to open a Surf and Ice Cream shop in Oahu, and if business would be sustained year round. 

## Results

* Based on the temperatures from our analysis, June has ideal temperatures for surfing and ice cream. The mean temperature of roughly 75 degrees is a perfect temperature for both surfing and ice cream.  While there is a chance of a minimum temperature of 64, it is highly unlikely since the standard deviation of temperatures is only 3.26.  The temperature will usually hover around the mid to high 70s.  You really can't beat Oahu in the summer time.


* December's temperatures are not too different from June's in Oahu. December is slightly colder than June, but it is still a comfotable temperature at a mean of 71 degrees.  The minimum temperature drops down to 56 which would be too cold for surfing and ice cream, however, like June, the standard deviation is low for DEcember at 3.75.  This indicates the chance of temperatures dropping fown to temperatures in the 50's is unlikely.  The temperatures will more than likely stay in the low to mid 70s with the potential to drop into the high 60's.  That may be a little cooler than some would preder, but it is still great weather for surfing and ice cream.

* The surf and ice cream shop should be in demand consistenetly based on the local weather analysis.  There is a slight chance it may get too cold in the colder months of thhttps://github.com/WIPartain/SurfsUp_Challenge/blob/main/Resources/June_Temps.pnge year, but based on June and DEcember, the majority of the days should be within a comfotable temperature throughout the year.  If we are basing the decision to open this business on weather, then I would certainly move forward with opening the surf and ice cream shop.

## Summary

While the temperature information might be important when determining how successful a surf and icecream shop might be, it is silly to use this as the sole variable for starting a business.  I ran additional queries to measure precipitation in June and December to determine if rainfall would affect business in Oahu, and it will probably not be a deterrent since the months appear to be similar in terms of rainfall as well as temperature.  I would urge the owners to focus on tourist dense areas with high levels of foot traffic as well as the quality of the nearby beach since weather will probably not be a determining factor in the level of business month to month.
